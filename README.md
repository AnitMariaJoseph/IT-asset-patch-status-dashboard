IT Asset & Patch Status Dashboard

This project is a practical demonstration of using Excel and Power Query to monitor IT assets and their patch compliance status across an organization.

Using a sample dataset of 250 devices, the dashboard includes:

Automated data cleaning and transformation using Power Query

Patch compliance flag based on days since last update

Calculated days since last patch for each device

Visual insights with pivot tables and charts showing compliance trends, high-risk systems, and overdue patches

Categorized data by OS, department, and device type for deeper analysis

This project reflects real-world IT support and asset management scenarios â€” ideal for environments where patch status, risk monitoring, and reporting are critical, even without enterprise tools like Power BI.
